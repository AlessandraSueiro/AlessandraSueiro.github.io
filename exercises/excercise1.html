    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a sophomore who is double majoring in English and Portuguese and Brazilian Studies and a member of the Commonwealth Honors College at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

<h2>Current Academics</h2>
<p>As someone who is a bilingual heritage speaker, my personal experience with language and literature has inspired my interest in the field of editing and translating, but overall working in the publishing field. Currently, I am focused on improving my creative and academic writing skills in both languages. </p>
